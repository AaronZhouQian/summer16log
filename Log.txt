The code is in the repository https://github.com/AaronZhouQian/tftutorial

Ran tfcnn.py, i.e. the tutorial code for CNN on MNIST, three times with the given
hyperparameters, with accuracies of 0.9925, 0.993, 0.9922.

Now we modify the hyperparameters.

First, add one more convolution without adding a max pooling layer.
The reason why we didn't add a max pooling layer is because after the third convolution layer,
the dimension of the images had become 7x7.
